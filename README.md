Assignment Overview
This assignment requires students to design and implement a professional multi screen mobile application using Expo. Working in groups of three, students will recreate the layout and navigation structure of a real world mobile application, demonstrating technical proficiency, collaborative development, and professional coding practices.
Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this assignment, students will be able to:
• Design and implement multi screen mobile applications using Expo.
• Apply tab and stack navigation patterns correctly.
• Recreate complex user interfaces from real world references.
• Collaborate effectively using GitHub version control.
• Produce clean, maintainable, and professional quality mobile application code.
Academic Integrity
Plagiarism detection software will be used on all submissions. Students must comply with SAIT’s Student Academic Conduct policy (A.C.3.4.3). Any form of academic misconduct may result in penalties as outlined by the institution.
Project Instructions

1. Reference Application Selection
• Select a real mobile application interface (e.g., Instagram, X, banking or shopping app).
• Capture screenshots of at least four related screens.
• The reference must demonstrate moderate to high interface complexity. Simple designs will not be accepted.


2. Project Setup
• Create a new Expo project using the TypeScript template:
  npx create-expo-app@latest
• Assign a meaningful project name and organize your files clearly.
3. Screen & Navigation Requirements
• Implement a minimum of FOUR (4) functional screens.
• Use Tab Navigation combined with at least one Stack Navigation flow.
• Each screen must include structured layout, icons, and consistent styling.
• At least one screen must include dynamic content such as lists, navigation parameters, or reusable components.
• As in the previous assignment, the core functionality of the app you are replicating does not need to be implemented, the only required functionality for this assignment is the navigation.
4. Team Collaboration (Groups of Three)
• Each group must contain exactly three students.
• All members must contribute code to the GitHub repository.
• Commit history will be reviewed to ensure equitable participation.
5. Submission Requirements
• Push your completed project to a GitHub repository and add all group members as collaborators.
• Ensure the application runs successfully on both iOS and Android.
• Submit the GitHub repository link and reference screenshots on Brightspace (D2L).
• Optionally remove node_modules and upload the source code as a compressed file.

Bonus (Optional – Up to 2 Extra Marks)
• Implement light/dark theme support
• Add simple animations or transitions
• Add a mock authentication or profile screen
